That's why we'll shortly be launching our smart but simple online ordering and delivery service.

You order the food you like from any airport or station restaurant or food retailer, and we deliver it to you at your boarding gate or platform. Different food from different restaurants? No problem.

Think of it as a little hamper of happiness from us to you at the start of your trip. </p>
